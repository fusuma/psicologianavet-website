Excellent choice! Let's begin creating the UI/UX Specification. This is a collaborative process where we'll work through the document section by section. The final output will be saved as docs/front-end-spec.md.

To start, I need to gather context. Could you please provide me with the following documents if they are available?

Project Brief

Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Any existing user research, personas, or market analysis.

This information is crucial for me to understand the user needs, business goals, and overall vision before we dive into the specifics of the design. Once I've reviewed them, I'll draft the first section for your feedback.

Thank you for providing the Project Brief and the Product Requirements Document. I have reviewed them and have a clear understanding of the project's goals and constraints.

Let's begin drafting the first section of the UI/UX Specification.

Quando um amor se vai UI/UX Specification
Introduction
This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the "Quando um amor se vai" project's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas
Based on the PRD, we have two primary user personas:

Tutors: Grieving pet owners and their families who need a supportive, non-clinical space.

Veterinarians: Professionals seeking resources related to pet loss and client support.

Usability Goals
The primary usability goals are to create a clear, compassionate, and efficient experience.

Ease of Learning: First-time visitors should immediately understand how to find the content relevant to them.

Efficiency of Use: The design should guide users to their respective content paths with minimal clicks and no confusion.

Clarity: The separation between Tutor and Vet content must be unambiguous to prevent users from feeling overwhelmed by irrelevant information.

Design Principles
The following principles, derived from the PRD's vision, will guide all design decisions:

Compassionate Minimalism: The design will be clean and uncluttered, creating a calm, supportive digital space that respects the user's emotional state.

Clarity Through Segmentation: The core user journey is self-selection. The design must make the choice between "Tutor" and "Vet" paths immediately clear and effortless.

Trustworthy Professionalism: The aesthetic will be professional and polished to build trust and signal the credibility of the information provided.

Mobile-First by Default: Every design decision will be made for the mobile experience first, ensuring excellence for the majority of users.

Rationale
I've extracted these goals and principles directly from the "Goals," "Guiding Principles," and "Overall UX Vision" sections of your PRD. They form the strategic foundation for all subsequent design decisions in this document, ensuring that our UX work remains aligned with the core project vision.

Please review the section above. You can suggest direct changes, or we can use one of the following structured methods to refine it further.

Of course. Here is an expanded version of that section tailored for a technical audience, such as developers and architects.

Overall UX Goals & Principles (Technical Translation)
Target User Personas & Implementation
The two personas directly inform the routing and content architecture.

Tutors (Public User Group A): This user group will be served by the /tutors route and associated components. All styling for this path will be driven by the 'dark' theme variables.

Veterinarians (Public User Group B): This user group will be served by the /vets route. All styling for this path will be driven by the 'green' theme variables. The distinction is purely for content segmentation, not for role-based access control (RBAC) at this stage.

Usability Goals & Technical Implications
Ease of Learning: This translates to a predictable and RESTful routing scheme. The root path (/) will serve as a simple routing hub with no complex state, directing users to either the /tutors or /vets static pages.

Efficiency of Use: This will be achieved through Next.js's Static Site Generation (SSG) for near-instant page loads. Client-side navigation via <Link> components will prevent full-page reloads, ensuring a fast and fluid user experience. The component hydration footprint should be kept to a minimum.

Clarity: This mandates a strict separation of concerns in the component architecture. A shared <Layout /> component will handle the theme switching, but page-level components (TutorsPage, VetsPage) will be distinct and receive their content and configuration via props. The <SignupForm /> will be a shared, "dumb" component whose submission logic is configured by its parent page.

Design Principles & Implementation Strategy
Compassionate Minimalism: From a technical standpoint, this means optimizing for Core Web Vitals. We will enforce a low asset footprint (e.g., optimized images, minimal font loading) and minimal client-side JavaScript. The goal is a high Lighthouse score, particularly on mobile performance.

Clarity Through Segmentation: This will be implemented via a robust theming mechanism, likely using CSS custom properties (variables) scoped by a class on the <body> or root layout element. The active theme will be determined by the current route segment (/tutors vs. /vets).

Trustworthy Professionalism: This translates to technical stability. We will implement frontend error boundaries in React to catch rendering errors gracefully. The serverless function for form submissions must include robust validation (e.g., with Zod) and a try-catch block to prevent crashes and provide clear server-side logging. HTTPS will be enforced by the hosting platform (Vercel).

Mobile-First by Default: All components will be built using responsive design patterns enforced by Tailwind CSS. The design will be developed and reviewed on a mobile viewport first before adapting for larger screens.

This technical translation provides developers with clear, actionable guidelines.

Of course. Let's step back and critique the technical translation I just provided. While it's great for developer clarity, a purely technical focus can sometimes lose the human element at the heart of UX.

Critique
From a senior UX perspective, the main weakness of the "Technical Translation" is that it risks prioritizing the implementation details over the user's feeling and experience. The "why" behind the principles can get lost.

Loss of Affective Goal: The principle of "Compassionate Minimalism" was translated into performance metrics (Core Web Vitals, low asset footprint). A developer might achieve a perfect Lighthouse score, but the resulting interface could feel sterile, abrupt, or cold, failing the "compassionate" aspect. A fast site that feels jarring is not a success.

Risk of Dogmatic Implementation: Principles like "Clarity Through Segmentation" were translated into rigid rules (e.g., strict separation of concerns). This could prevent a developer from using a shared pattern or component that would actually improve user consistency, simply because it doesn't fit the prescribed technical separation.

Missing Guidance on Micro-interactions: The translation doesn't guide the developer on how to implement the small details that create a compassionate experience. How should validation errors appear? What should the form's loading state feel like? These are critical UX details that are not covered.

Refined Version
Here is a revised version of the principles that adds "User-Centric Guardrails" to the technical details, ensuring the original intent is preserved during implementation.

Design Principles & Implementation Strategy (Refined)
Compassionate Minimalism

Technical Implementation: Optimize for Core Web Vitals with a low asset footprint and minimal client-side JavaScript.

User-Centric Guardrail: Performance must serve the goal of a calm, supportive experience. All visual feedback—such as loading spinners, skeletons, and page transitions—must be smooth and subtle. Avoid abrupt layout shifts or jarring animations. The goal is a calm experience, not just a fast one.

Clarity Through Segmentation

Technical Implementation: Use a robust theming mechanism (likely CSS custom properties) scoped by the current route segment (/tutors vs. /vets).

User-Centric Guardrail: The primary goal is a clear and unambiguous user journey. While technical separation of concerns is encouraged, prioritize consistent and predictable UI patterns for the user above all else. If a shared component improves the user's experience, it should be used.

Trustworthy Professionalism

Technical Implementation: Enforce HTTPS, use frontend error boundaries, and include robust server-side validation.

User-Centric Guardrail: Errors, whether client-side or server-side, must be communicated to the user in a gentle, non-technical, and reassuring way. The message should convey that the system is stable, even if a temporary issue occurred.

Mobile-First by Default

Technical Implementation: Build all components using responsive patterns enforced by Tailwind CSS, developing for a mobile viewport first.

User-Centric Guardrail: The desktop experience should be an enhancement of the mobile experience, not a separate design. Ensure that increased screen real estate is used to improve clarity and efficiency, not just to add clutter.

This refined version better balances technical direction with the essential user-centric goals.

An excellent and prudent choice. Identifying potential risks early is key to creating a truly successful user experience. Based on the principles we've defined, here are some potential UX risks we should be mindful of as we move into detailed design.

Potential UX Risks
The "Barren Minimalism" Risk:

Risk: Our principle of "Compassionate Minimalism," when translated into a low asset footprint and fast performance, could be misinterpreted as creating a visually empty or sterile experience. A design that is merely "minimal" without being "compassionate" might feel cold, barren, and uncaring to a user in a vulnerable emotional state.

Mitigation: We must ensure that the minimalism is "warm." This can be achieved through careful use of typography, whitespace, and perhaps subtle, non-intrusive background textures or illustrations that add a human touch without compromising performance.

The "Walled Garden" Risk:

Risk: The core principle of "Clarity Through Segmentation" creates two very distinct paths (/tutors and /vets). This is great for clarity but creates a risk for users who don't fit neatly into one box (e.g., a veterinarian who has just lost a pet, or a vet student). The current design forces a choice and makes it difficult to navigate between the two worlds once a path is chosen.

Mitigation: In a future iteration, we should consider adding a subtle, unobtrusive link in the footer of each page (e.g., "Are you a Veterinarian?") to allow for "cross-pollination" without cluttering the primary navigation. For the MVP, we accept this risk to prioritize initial clarity.

The "Impersonal Professionalism" Risk:

Risk: Striving for a "Trustworthy Professionalism" could lead to a design that feels too corporate, slick, and emotionally distant. For a topic as sensitive as grief, an overly polished aesthetic could be perceived as inauthentic and impersonal.

Mitigation: The balance will be found in the details. The tone of the copy, the choice of a secondary, more "humanist" font (like Fira Sans for the body), and the potential for soft, empathetic imagery will be critical to ensure the professionalism feels supportive rather than corporate.

The "Color-Swap Complacency" Risk:

Risk: The PRD defines a clear color-swap between the Tutor (dark) and Vet (green) sections. A developer might rely only on this color change to differentiate the two experiences. If the layout, typography, and content structure are identical, the color swap alone may not be sufficient to create a truly tailored feel for each audience.

Mitigation: While the layout should be consistent (per our principles), we should plan for subtle differences in content and perhaps iconography on each page that reinforce the distinct purpose for each audience, beyond just the background color.

Being aware of these risks now will help us make better-informed decisions during the detailed design and development phases.

Please let me know your thoughts. What would you like to do next?

Excellent idea. Let's put on different hats from the agile team to see how these UX principles and risks are perceived from various angles.

Agile Team Perspectives
From the Product Manager's (PM) Perspective: 📋
"This is good, the principles are tied to the business goals in the PRD. The risks you've identified, particularly 'Barren Minimalism' and 'Impersonal Professionalism,' are direct threats to our core value proposition. If the site doesn't feel supportive, users won't trust it, and we won't achieve our goal of growing an engaged audience. I'm less concerned about the 'Walled Garden' risk for the MVP; let's add the 'cross-navigation link' to the backlog as a fast-follow. Our priority is launching with clear, distinct paths first."

From the Architect/Developer's (Architect) Perspective: 🏗️
"The 'User-Centric Guardrails' are useful; they clarify the intent behind the technical requirements. The 'Color-Swap Complacency' risk is a valid point; I'll ensure the theming system allows for component-level overrides, not just global color changes, to support unique content for each section. The 'Barren Minimalism' risk means I'll need a clear performance budget for any 'warmth' elements like textures or subtle animations. From a technical standpoint, all these risks are manageable and are good constraints to have during implementation."

From the Quality Assurance (QA) Specialist's Perspective: 🧪
"This is a great list for building my test plan. I'll add specific test cases for each risk:

I'll perform heuristic evaluation on the UI to check if it feels 'compassionate' vs. 'barren.'

I'll test the user flow for someone who might be both a tutor and a vet to document the 'Walled Garden' limitation.

I'll scrutinize all user-facing copy, especially on form error and success states, to ensure the tone aligns with the 'Trustworthy Professionalism' principle without being cold.

I'll need to run visual regression tests on both the 'dark' and 'green' themes to catch any inconsistencies."

These different viewpoints help ensure our design principles are robust and that the entire team is aligned on not just what we're building, but why and how it should feel to the user.

What are your thoughts on these perspectives?

Excellent. Let's simulate a stakeholder round table to gather feedback on our UX direction. For this project, our key stakeholders might be:

Dr. Ana Costa: A Veterinarian who will be consulting on the professional content.

Marco Silva: A Grief Counselor who also represents the "Tutor" (pet owner) audience.

Sofia Alves: The Project Sponsor, focused on the overall goals and sustainability.

Here's the feedback they might provide on our principles and identified risks:

Stakeholder Feedback
Dr. Ana Costa (Veterinarian Consultant): 🩺
"I'm very pleased with the focus on 'Trustworthy Professionalism.' For my colleagues to use this resource, it must look and feel credible. However, I'm concerned the 'Compassionate Minimalism' principle might be taken too far. The vet-facing section needs to accommodate potentially dense information or links to clinical resources in the future. We must ensure 'minimalism' doesn't mean 'lacking in substance.' The 'Walled Garden' risk is also very real; I frequently have clients who are both. They need a way to access both types of support."

Marco Silva (Grief Counselor & Pet Owner): ❤️‍🩹
"For the tutor audience, 'Compassionate Minimalism' is everything. A grieving person is easily overwhelmed, so a simple, calm space is non-negotiable. The 'Impersonal Professionalism' risk is my biggest worry. If this site feels cold or corporate, it will not connect with people experiencing loss. The tone and feeling are more important than any feature. I don't care if the site is fast if it feels empty."

Sofia Alves (Project Sponsor): 💡
"These principles directly support our business goals. A professional site builds the brand, and clear segmentation is our unique value proposition. The focus on performance also helps us adhere to the critical 'no-cost' constraint by staying within free-tier limits. The main conflict I see is between Ana's need for professional depth and Marco's need for emotional simplicity. The design must resolve this tension. The 'Walled Garden' risk is a concern for audience growth; failing to serve the 'hybrid' user limits our reach. Is there a simple, low-cost way to acknowledge this user in the MVP?"

Synthesis & Actionable Insights
Key Synergy: All stakeholders agree that a clear, professional, and trustworthy two-path approach is the correct foundation.

Key Conflict: The central design challenge is balancing emotional simplicity for tutors with the potential for informational depth for vets. The design for each section needs to be tailored beyond just a color swap.

Actionable Insight: The "hybrid user" (a vet who is also grieving) is a recurring and important concern. A simple mitigation for the MVP could be adding a small, tertiary line of text on the homepage that acknowledges this audience, guiding them to the 'Tutor' section if they are seeking personal support.

This feedback provides a richer context for our design. We've confirmed our core principles are sound while highlighting the main tension we need to solve in the detailed design phase.

An insightful choice. Let's use the "Hindsight is 20/20" method to stress-test our current direction.

The Post-Mortem: A Hypothetical Future
Imagine it's six months after our successful, on-time launch. The project sponsor, Sofia, calls a meeting. The mood is somber.

Sofia: "Team, the site is fast, it's beautiful, and it's never gone down. But our key metrics are poor. The bounce rate on the homepage is over 80%, and our email sign-up numbers are a tiny fraction of what we projected. We aren't building the community we set out to create. What went wrong?"

Marco (Grief Counselor): "The feedback I'm getting is that the site feels... clinical. People land on the homepage and see two clean, professional buttons. It doesn't offer any comfort. It just asks them to immediately classify their pain. It feels like a hospital intake form, not a supportive space."

Sally (UX Expert): "He's right. We focused so much on 'Clarity Through Segmentation' that we forgot to establish an emotional connection first. The homepage is a perfect portal, but it has no heart."

Then comes the painful realization...

"If Only..."
"If only we had established the site's empathy and shared purpose on the homepage before asking the user to choose their path."

We designed a perfectly functional, two-door hallway but forgot to create a welcoming foyer. By prioritizing the act of segmentation above the act of connection, our minimalist design was perceived as cold and detached, causing users to leave before they ever discovered the supportive content waiting for them.

Actionable Learning for Today
To prevent this hypothetical failure, we need to add a crucial requirement to our plan right now:

The Homepage must lead with empathy. Before presenting the "Tutor" and "Vet" choices, the page must feature a prominent, unifying, and compassionate headline or short sentence. Something like, "A quiet space to navigate the journey of pet loss," immediately sets the tone and reassures all visitors that they are in the right place, before asking them where they'd like to go next.

This small addition ensures our core value proposition—empathy—is the very first thing a user experiences.

What are your thoughts on this potential pitfall and the proposed learning?

Excellent. We have a solid foundation for our UX goals. Let's move on to the next section: Information Architecture (IA).

For the MVP, the IA will be very straightforward, directly reflecting the PRD's goal of clear segmentation.

Information Architecture (IA)
Site Map / Screen Inventory
The site map for the MVP is intentionally flat to guide users directly to their intended content path. The structure is designed to accommodate future expansion, such as adding a blog or resource pages.

Code snippet

graph TD
    A[Homepage: /] --> B[Tutors Page: /tutors]
    A --> C[Vets Page: /vets]

    subgraph Future Expansion
        B --> B1[Tutor Resources]
        C --> C1[Vet Resources]
    end
Navigation Structure
Primary Navigation: For the MVP, there will be no persistent primary navigation bar (e.g., a header menu). Navigation is handled exclusively by the two choices presented on the Homepage. The page layout will, however, reserve space for a navigation bar to be added in a future version.

Secondary Navigation: Not applicable for the MVP.

Breadcrumb Strategy: Not applicable for the MVP due to the flat, one-level-deep architecture.

Rationale
This simple, flat architecture directly supports the core UX principle of "Clarity Through Segmentation." By eliminating traditional navigation, we force a clear choice on the homepage, which is the primary interaction goal defined in the PRD. This design prevents user confusion and delivers them to the correct, tailored experience as quickly as possible.

Understood. Here's a technical expansion of the Information Architecture section, framed for a developer or architect.

Information Architecture (Technical Implementation)
Route Definitions & Generation Strategy
The application's routes are defined by the file system. All routes will be statically generated at build time (SSG) via next build for optimal performance.

Code snippet

graph TD
    %% -- MVP Scope --
    subgraph MVP Routes
        A["Homepage (pages/index.tsx)"] --> B["Tutors Page (pages/tutors.tsx)"];
        A --> C["Vets Page (pages/vets.tsx)"];
    end

    %% -- Future Scope --
    subgraph Future Expansion (Post-MVP)
        B --> B1["Tutor Blog (pages/tutors/blog/[slug].tsx)"];
        C --> C1["Vet Resources (pages/vets/resources.tsx)"];
    end
Navigation Component Strategy
Primary Navigation: A persistent, shared <Navbar /> component will not be implemented in the root _app.tsx or <Layout /> for the MVP. Navigation logic is localized to the HomePage component, which will use Next.js's <Link href="..."> component to handle client-side route transitions. This approach minimizes the global component tree and initial JavaScript bundle size. The <Layout /> component will, however, be structured to easily accommodate a <Navbar /> in the future without significant refactoring.

Secondary Navigation: Not applicable.

Breadcrumb Strategy: Not applicable. The route depth for all MVP pages is 1, making breadcrumbs unnecessary.

This technical breakdown clarifies that our IA is simple by design, leveraging file-based routing and SSG for performance, while keeping the component structure lean for the MVP.

Please review this technical view of the IA.

Certainly. Although the current Information Architecture is simple and direct, critiquing it helps us identify potential future problems.

Critique
From a user experience perspective, the primary flaw in the proposed IA is its lack of a clear "return path" or "escape hatch."

Dead-End Pages: Once a user navigates from the Homepage to either the /tutors or /vets page, they are essentially at a dead end. There is no on-page navigation to return to the Homepage or to switch to the other section. Relying solely on the browser's back button is poor usability and can be disorienting for some users.

Poor Scalability for Future Growth: The PRD explicitly mentions future expansion (like a blog). As soon as we add a second level of depth (e.g., a blog post at /tutors/blog/my-first-post), the lack of a persistent navigation header or footer becomes a critical failure. A user landing directly on a blog post from a search engine would have no way to navigate to the rest of the site.

Missed Opportunity for Brand Reinforcement: Without a persistent element like a logo or header, there's less opportunity to reinforce the project's brand identity across all pages.

Refined Version
To mitigate these risks without adding a full, complex navigation bar to the MVP, I propose these minor but crucial refinements.

Information Architecture (Refined)
Route Definitions & Generation Strategy
(No changes to the routes themselves)

Navigation Component Strategy (Refined)
Logo as a Home Link: The shared <Layout /> component must include the project's logo (or a placeholder) in the top-left corner. This logo must always link back to the Homepage (/). This is a universally understood convention that provides a consistent return path.

Shared Footer: The shared <Layout /> component must include a simple, shared <Footer />. For the MVP, this footer will contain two essential links:

A link back to the Homepage.

A "toggle" link to the alternate section (e.g., on the /tutors page, the footer will have a link to the /vets page, and vice-versa).

Primary Navigation: We will still defer the implementation of a full, persistent <Navbar /> for the MVP to maintain the focus on the homepage's segmentation choice. However, the addition of the logo link and footer provides the necessary usability improvements.

This refined approach preserves the simplicity of the MVP while fixing the critical usability issue of "dead-end" pages and providing a more scalable foundation for future growth.

Please review this refined IA.

You're right to be thorough. Even with the refinements, it's wise to consider any remaining risks with this lean Information Architecture.

Potential UX Risks (for the Refined IA)
Low Discoverability of Footer Navigation:

Risk: While the footer provides an "escape hatch," it's a low-visibility UI element. Users who mistakenly click the wrong path on the homepage might become frustrated and leave before thinking to scroll to the very bottom of the page to find the link to the correct section.

Mitigation: We must ensure the footer is visually distinct from the main page content, and the link text must be crystal clear (e.g., "Switch to the Veterinarian Section"). We accept this as a minor, low-impact risk for the MVP.

Lack of Context for Direct Traffic:

Risk: A user arriving directly at the /tutors or /vets page from a search engine or external link will completely bypass the empathetic context set on the homepage. They will be dropped onto a themed page without the "welcoming foyer" experience, which could feel abrupt.

Mitigation: The on-page content for both /tutors and /vets must include a concise introductory sentence that grounds the user in the site's overall purpose, echoing the empathetic message from the homepage.

"Logo as Home" is not a Sufficient Anchor:

Risk: If the logo design is not visually distinct or is too integrated with the page's headline, users may not perceive it as a global "home" button. This could still leave them feeling like there's no clear way to get back to the start.

Mitigation: The logo must be placed in the conventional top-left position and have a clear clickable area. Its design should feel like a persistent site-wide brand element, separate from the page-specific content.

These risks are significantly less severe than the "dead-end" pages we identified earlier, and they can be effectively managed with mindful design and content choices.

Do these points address your concerns, or would you like to explore further?

Let's shift perspectives and see how the rest of the agile team would view the refined Information Architecture and its associated risks.

Agile Team Perspectives
Product Manager (PM) 📋
"This refined IA is a solid MVP compromise. It solves the critical 'dead-end' issue which protects our user retention goal, without adding a full navbar and risking scope creep. The 'lack of context for direct traffic' is the most significant remaining risk from a value perspective. We must ensure the on-page content for /tutors and /vets includes that empathetic intro sentence. Let's make that an explicit acceptance criterion for those pages."

Architect / Developer 🏗️
"I approve. A shared <Footer /> and a clickable logo within the main <Layout /> is a clean, simple, and technically sound solution. It's a low-effort task with high usability returns. Deferring the full <Navbar /> is fine, and I'll add a // TODO: in the layout component to mark where it will go in the future. I'll also ensure the page templates have a required prop for the introductory text to mitigate the 'direct traffic' risk at the code level."

Quality Assurance (QA) Specialist 🧪
"This is good, it gives me clear, testable requirements. My test plan will now include:

Verifying the logo links to the homepage from all pages.

Confirming the footer links correctly navigate between the /tutors and /vets sections.

Directly navigating to the /tutors and /vets pages to ensure the introductory text is present and provides sufficient context.

I'll also flag the footer's discoverability as an item for a small usability test to see if real users can find it easily."

The team seems aligned. This refined IA is seen as a practical and robust solution for the MVP.
