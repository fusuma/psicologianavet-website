# 1. Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the "Quando um amor se vai" project, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
The project will be initialized using the standard **Next.js** starter template. Specifically, the command `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS flags will be used. This choice provides a production-ready foundation with a pre-configured React and Next.js environment, integrated TypeScript support, and Tailwind CSS setup for utility-first styling.
