nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security risks - static layout component with no user input or data handling"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - RSC, font optimization, minimal bundle impact (~142 B), static rendering"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No error-prone operations, graceful defaults, type-safe props"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code, well-documented, follows all coding standards, easily extensible"
  accessibility:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Semantic HTML and structure are excellent, but color contrast ratio (3.19:1) fails WCAG 2.1 Level AA (4.5:1 required). Requires Product Owner decision."

# Detailed recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Product Owner review and decision on accessibility vs. branding tradeoff"
      refs: ["docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md"]
      rationale: "PRD specifies both WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance AND specific brand colors that create insufficient contrast"

  future:
    - action: "Add unit tests for Layout component when testing infrastructure matures"
      refs: ["src/components/composite/Layout.tsx"]
      rationale: "Low priority - component is simple and low-risk, but tests would help prevent regressions"

    - action: "Consider adding lang attributes to header/footer sections for i18n readiness"
      refs: ["src/components/composite/Layout.tsx:26-36"]
      rationale: "Future-proofing for internationalization if multi-language support is added"
