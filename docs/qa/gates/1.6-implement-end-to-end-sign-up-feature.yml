# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.6
schema: 1
story: "1.6"
story_title: "Implement End-to-End Sign-up Feature"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is code-complete and follows all standards, but E2E tests are failing due to Cypress port configuration mismatch (config expects port 3000, server runs on 3001). Test verification is blocked pending configuration fix."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Quality scoring
quality_score: 75
# Calculation: 100 - (10 × 2 medium CONCERNS) - (5 × 1 low CONCERN) = 75

# Evidence collected during review
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 7
  risks_identified: 3
  files_refactored: 2
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
    ac_gaps: [4, 8]  # AC4: Brevo not tested with live API; AC8: E2E tests failing

# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Honeypot protection, server-side validation, no secret exposure, proper error handling. Recommend rate limiting for production."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bundle size 125 kB (acceptable), build successful, no performance bottlenecks identified."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "E2E tests failing due to configuration (not implementation). Manual testing required to verify reliability."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, follows all coding standards, explicit types throughout."

# Review audit trail
history:
  - at: "2025-10-06T20:00:00Z"
    gate: CONCERNS
    note: "Initial QA review - Code quality excellent, tests failing due to config issue. Fixed accessibility violations and improved test selectors during review."

# Additional context
notes: |
  Code quality is production-ready. Implementation demonstrates solid architecture with:
  - Clean controller/service separation
  - Type-safe Zod validation
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Reusable component design
  - Proper security measures (honeypot, server-side validation)

  Refactoring performed during review:
  1. Added ARIA landmark roles to Layout component (accessibility fix)
  2. Improved Cypress test selectors for reliability

  Gate set to CONCERNS solely due to test configuration blocking verification.
  Estimated resolution time: 30 minutes (config fix + test run + Brevo test).

  Recommendation: Fix port configuration and re-review, or accept CONCERNS gate with manual testing as mitigation.
