# 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision is to create a clean, minimalist, and compassionate digital space. The design should feel professional and trustworthy, guiding users gently to the information they need without overwhelming them. The user journey must prioritize immediate audience segmentation to reduce confusion and deliver relevant content as quickly as possible.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

The Home Page will act as a portal, with the primary interaction being the user's self-selection into one of two paths: 'Tutors' or '**Vets**'. Each choice will be accompanied by a brief, clarifying subline (e.g., for Tutors: 'For pet owners and families'). Once a user chooses their path, they will be taken to a dedicated landing page for that audience. For the MVP, these landing pages will not have further sub-navigation. However, the page layout should be designed to easily accommodate a navigation bar for future expansion (e.g., adding a blog or resources page).

### Core Screens and Views

1.  Home Page (acting as a portal to the two main sections)
2.  Tutors Page (with sign-up form)
3.  **Vets** Page (with sign-up form)

### Accessibility

The goal will be to meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance.
