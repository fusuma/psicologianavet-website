## Background Context

The "Quando um amor se vai" project aims to provide a supportive online resource for pet owners (Tutors) and Veterinarians dealing with pet loss. The primary challenge is to present information that respects the different needs of these two audiences. This requires a solution that offers clear content segregation and distinct user journeys while maintaining a cohesive and professional brand.
