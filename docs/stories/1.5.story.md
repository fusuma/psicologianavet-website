## Dev Notes

### Content Specification

**\[Source: docs/content/website-content.md#Página para Tutores\]**

**CRITICAL**: All tutors page content is specified in Portuguese in the content document. Do NOT use placeholder or generic English text.

**Headline:**
"Honre o Amor que Vocês Compartilharam"

**Body Copy:**

Todo animal que passa pela nossa vida deixa marcas de amor incondicional, alegria e aprendizado. Quando um amor se vai, a dor que sentimos é a medida exata do amor que vivemos.

Este espaço foi criado para você que:

* Deseja honrar a memória de um companheiro especial
* Busca apoio gentil para processar a perda
* Quer celebrar o vínculo único que compartilhou com seu pet

"Quando um amor se vai" é um guia psicológico escrito por **Gisele Schneider**, psicóloga especialista no vínculo humano-animal, para acompanhar você nessa jornada de recordação, gratidão e cura.

**Content Notes:**

* Language: Portuguese (pt-BR)
* Tone: Compassionate, professional, hopeful
* Focus: Warm and welcoming, emphasizing the bond between humans and pets
* Do NOT translate or modify the content - use exactly as specified
* **Note**: For this story (1.5), implement only the headline and body copy sections. Future stories (1.6+) will add the lead magnet form and additional CTAs.

### Previous Story Insights

**\[Source: Story 1.4 Dev Agent Record\]**

* `<Layout />` component available at `src/components/composite/Layout.tsx` with theme support
* Layout accepts `theme` prop with values `'dark'` or `'green'`
* Typography fully configured: Castoro for headings (small caps), Fira Sans for body text
* CSS variables defined for `.theme-dark` and `.theme-green` in `src/app/globals.css`
* Layout provides semantic HTML structure: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
* All components follow Server Component pattern by default
* Homepage at `/` already includes link to `/tutors` page (created in Story 1.4)

**\[Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record\]**

* Accessibility concern noted: Color contrast of 3.19:1 for dark/green combinations may not meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA (4.5:1 required for body text)
* Consider using muted-foreground or alternative colors if text contrast is insufficient

### User Experience Requirements

**\[Source: docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md#Overall UX Vision\]**

* Design should feel **clean, minimalist, and compassionate**
* Professional and trustworthy appearance
* Guide users gently without overwhelming them
* Dedicated landing page for Tutors audience (separate from Vets)

**\[Source: docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md#Key Interaction Paradigms\]**

* Tutors page is a dedicated landing page reached after self-selection on homepage
* MVP landing pages will not have sub-navigation, but layout accommodates future expansion
* Focus on delivering relevant content to the segmented audience

**\[Source: docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md#Core Screens and Views\]**

* Tutors Page (with sign-up form) is one of the three core screens
* Note: Sign-up form will be added in Story 1.6, not in this story

### Technology Stack

**\[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md\]**

* **Framework**: Next.js \~14.x with App Router
* **Language**: TypeScript \~5.x with strict mode
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS \~3.x
* **Typography**: `next/font/google` for Castoro and Fira Sans (already configured)

### Component Architecture

**\[Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture\]**

* **Default Pattern**: React Server Components (RSC)
* Only add `"use client"` directive when client-side interactivity is required
* Tutors page is primarily presentational content - **Server Component is appropriate**

**\[Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Architecture\]**

* **Pattern**: Next.js App Router (`/app` directory)
* Routes defined by `page.tsx` files
* Tutors page is `src/app/tutors/page.tsx`

### Branding & Design System

**\[Source: docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md#Branding\]**

**Typography:**

* **Headings**: Castoro (rendered in small caps) ← Already configured in Story 1.3
* **Body Text**: Fira Sans ← Already configured in Story 1.3

**Color Palette:**

* **Primary Dark**: #191723
* **Primary Green**: #269A9B
* **Neutral**: #fff (White)

**Color Application:**

* **Tutors Section**: Dark background (#191723) with Green text (#269A9B)

**Theme Selection for Tutors Page:**

* Use `theme='dark'` for tutors page as specified in AC2 and color application standards

```

**File Location**: `src/app/tutors/page.tsx` (new file to be created)

### Coding Standards

**\[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#4. React & Next.js Standards\]**

**Component Standards:**

* Server Components by default (no `"use client"` unless needed)
* Explicit return type: `ReactElement` or `JSX.Element`
* One component per file
* No `any` types - use explicit types
* Explicit return types for all functions

**Component Template Pattern:**

```typescript
import type { ReactElement } from 'react';
import { Layout } from '@/components/composite/Layout';

export default function TutorsPage(): ReactElement {
  return (
    <Layout theme="dark">
      {/* Page content */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

**\[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#4.3 Next.js Specific Standards\]**

**Metadata for SEO:**

```typescript
import { type Metadata } from 'next';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title',
  description: 'Page description',
};
```

**\[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#5. Styling Standards\]**

* **Utility-First**: Use Tailwind utilities instead of custom CSS
* **Conditional Classes**: Use `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`, etc.)
* **Class Organization**: Layout → Sizing → Spacing → Colors → Typography → Effects

### Accessibility Standards

**\[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#9. Accessibility Standards\]**

* **Goal**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
* **Semantic HTML**: Use `<section>`, `<main>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, etc.
* **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
* **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for text
* **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
* **Accessible Names**: Ensure clear, descriptive text for any interactive elements

**Accessibility Consideration**: Story 1.3 noted potential contrast issues with dark/green combinations (3.19:1). For body text, consider using white or muted-foreground colors to maintain WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (4.5:1 ratio). Green (#269A9B) can be used for headings or accents where appropriate.

### Testing Requirements

**\[Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md\]**

* **Testing Pyramid**: Unit, Integration, and E2E (Cypress) tests
* **For This Story**: Manual verification sufficient
  * No complex interactivity requiring unit tests
  * Simple presentational content can be manually tested
  * Future E2E tests (Story 1.6+) will cover full user journeys including navigation and form submission
* **Manual Verification**:
  * Run `npm run dev` and test tutors page locally
  * Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
  * Test responsive design at different breakpoints
  * Verify navigation from homepage works correctly

### Implementation Notes


1. **Server Component**: Tutors page should remain a Server Component (no state, no event handlers, just static content)
2. **Layout Theme**: Use `theme='dark'` as specified in AC2 and branding guidelines
3. **Simplicity**: Keep content minimal and focused - headline and body copy only for MVP
4. **Future-Ready**: Design should accommodate future enhancements (lead magnet form in Story 1.6) but don't over-build
5. **Typography**: Headings will automatically render in Castoro with small caps (configured globally in Story 1.3)
6. **Portuguese Content**: All content is in Portuguese (pt-BR) as specified in docs/content/website-content.md. Do not translate or use English placeholders.
7. **Homepage Link**: Homepage already has link to `/tutors` (created in Story 1.4), so navigation should work once this page is created
8. **Content Scope**: Implement only headline and body copy sections. Do NOT implement lead magnet form, CTAs, or footer content - those are future stories.

## Testing

**\[Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md\]**

* **Testing Approach**: Manual verification
* **Test File Location**: Not required for this story (presentational content only)
* **Testing Frameworks**: Future E2E tests will use Cypress and `cypress-axe`
* **Specific Testing Requirements**:
  * Manual testing of page rendering and navigation
  * Responsive design verification across mobile, tablet, desktop
  * TypeScript compilation verification via `npm run build`
  * Visual verification of brand alignment (colors, typography, spacing)
