## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**\[Source: Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record\]**

* Project structure already created with `src/components/ui/` and `src/components/composite/` directories ready for use
* TypeScript strict mode enabled - all functions require explicit return types
* Tailwind CSS 3.x already configured and working
* Next.js 14.x with App Router in place
* Coding standards require explicit return types (`ReactElement` for React components)

### Technology Stack Requirements

**\[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md\]**

**UI Component Library:**

* **Shadcn/UI**: \~0.x - Foundation for all UI components
  * Purpose: Accelerates development with accessible, themeable components
* **Radix UI**: \~1.x - Accessible, headless primitives
  * Purpose: Foundation of Shadcn/UI, providing best-in-class accessibility

**Already Installed (from Story 1.1):**

* TypeScript: \~5.x
* Next.js: \~14.x
* Tailwind CSS: \~3.x
* React: Built-in with Next.js

### Component Architecture

**\[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture\]**

* **Component Organization**: Uses clean `src/components/ui` (for Shadcn/UI) and `src/components/composite` (for feature components) structure
* **Component Template**: Components default to **React Server Components (RSC)**. The `"use client";` directive must be added only when client-side interactivity (hooks, event handlers) is required

### Base UI Components to Initialize

**\[Source: architecture/6-components.md#Base UI Components (via Shadcn/UI)\]**

* **Button**: A polymorphic button component
* **Form Primitives (Input, Label)**: Accessible foundation for forms

These components will be used later to build composite components like `<SignupForm />` and `<Layout />`.

### Project Structure Alignment

**\[Source: architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md\]**

```plaintext
/quandounamorsevai
├── src/
│   ├── components/               # All reusable FE components
│   │   ├── ui/                   # Shadcn/UI primitives ← THIS STORY
│   │   └── composite/            # Feature-specific components (future stories)
│   └── lib/                      # Third-party configurations (Shadcn utils)
```

**Note**: The `src/components/ui/` directory already exists from Story 1.1. Shadcn/UI will populate it with components. The `src/lib/` directory will be created during Shadcn/UI initialization for the `cn()` utility function.

### Styling & Theming Requirements

**\[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#5. Styling Standards\]**

* **Utility-First Approach**: Use Tailwind utilities instead of custom CSS
* **Conditional Classes**: Use `clsx` or `cn` utility for conditional classes
* **Custom Colors**: Use CSS variables defined in `globals.css`
* **Shadcn/UI Theme**: Use Shadcn/UI's theming system via CSS variables

**CSS Variables for Theming:**
The project will use CSS variables for the 'dark' and 'green' themes as mentioned in Story 1.3. Shadcn/UI's CSS variable-based theming system aligns perfectly with this requirement.

### Coding Standards to Follow

**\[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md\]**

**TypeScript Standards:**

* No `any` type - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
* All functions must have explicit return types
* Use `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections
* TypeScript strict mode enabled (already configured)

**Component Standards:**

* One component per file
* File name must match component name (PascalCase)
* Server Components by default (no `"use client"` unless interactivity needed)
* Components must have explicit return type: `JSX.Element` or `ReactElement`

**File Naming:**

* Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx`)

### Testing Requirements

**\[Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md\]**

* **Testing Pyramid**: Unit, Integration, and E2E (Cypress) tests
* **Frontend Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, jest-axe for unit and integration testing
* **E2E Testing**: Cypress and cypress-axe for full user journey and accessibility compliance

**For This Story**: No tests required - this is component library initialization only. The installed components (Button, Input, Label) come from Shadcn/UI which are already tested. Testing will be added in subsequent stories when we build feature components.

### Shadcn/UI Installation Notes

**Installation Process:**



1. Run `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` - sets up configuration
2. Run `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]` - installs individual components

**Expected Files Created:**

* `components.json` - Shadcn/UI configuration file
* `src/lib/utils.ts` - Contains `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
* `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - Button component
* `src/components/ui/input.tsx` - Input component
* `src/components/ui/label.tsx` - Label component

**Dependencies Added:**

* `class-variance-authority` (CVA) - For variant management
* `clsx` - For conditional class merging
* `tailwind-merge` - For Tailwind class conflict resolution
* `@radix-ui/react-*` packages - Accessible primitives for each component

### Important Implementation Notes



1. **CSS Variables Required**: Shadcn/UI requires CSS variables for theming. During init, ensure "CSS variables" option is selected.
2. **Tailwind Integration**: Shadcn/UI will modify `tailwind.config.ts` to add necessary theme extensions and plugins.
3. **TypeScript Compatibility**: All Shadcn/UI components are fully typed with TypeScript.
4. **Accessibility Built-In**: Radix UI primitives provide WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility out of the box.
5. **Server Components**: Shadcn/UI components work with React Server Components. Only add `"use client"` when you compose them into interactive features.

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of Shadcn/UI component library initialization. All acceptance criteria fully met with high-quality code. The implementation follows industry best practices for accessible component libraries using Radix UI primitives and CSS variable-based theming. Configuration is clean and well-structured. Build passes successfully with type safety intact.

### Refactoring Performed

**Coding Standards Compliance Fix:**

* **File**: `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
  * **Change**: Added explicit return type `: React.ReactElement` to forwardRef function
  * **Why**: Coding standards section 3.1.2 requires "All functions must have explicit return types" and section 4.1.3 requires "Components must have explicit return type: `JSX.Element` or `ReactElement`"
  * **How**: Changed function signature from `(..., ref) => {` to `(..., ref): React.ReactElement => {` to satisfy TypeScript strict typing requirements
* **File**: `src/components/ui/input.tsx`
  * **Change**: Added explicit return type `: React.ReactElement` to forwardRef function
  * **Why**: Same coding standards requirement for explicit return types on all functions
  * **How**: Applied same pattern as Button component for consistency
* **File**: `src/components/ui/label.tsx`
  * **Change**: Added explicit return type `: React.ReactElement` to forwardRef function
  * **Why**: Same coding standards requirement for explicit return types on all functions
  * **How**: Applied same pattern for consistency across all UI primitives

**Verification**: Build executed successfully after refactoring (npm run build ✓)

### Compliance Check

* **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASS** (after refactoring)
  * Section 3.1.2 (Explicit return types): ✓ Now compliant
