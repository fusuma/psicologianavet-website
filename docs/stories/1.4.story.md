# Story 1.4: Build the Homepage Portal

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** first-time Visitor,
**I want** a clear homepage that helps me self-identify into either the Tutors or Vets audience,
**so that** I can quickly navigate to the content and services most relevant to me.

## Acceptance Criteria


1. The homepage (`/`) is created using Next.js App Router at `src/app/page.tsx`.
2. The page includes a hero section with the headline "Se hoje há dor, é porque ontem houve amor." and subheadline "Um espaço de acolhimento e memória para honrar o vínculo que nunca se perde."
3. The page presents two clear navigation options: "Sou Tutor" and "Sou Parceiro Veterinário" as specified in docs/content/website-content.md.
4. Each option includes a clarifying subline using the Portuguese content specified in docs/content/website-content.md (Tutors: "Para quem compartilha a vida com um animal de estimação", Vets: "Para profissionais que cuidam de animais e seus tutores").
5. Each option links to the respective dedicated page (`/tutors` for Tutors, `/vets` for Vets).
6. The page follows the UX design goals: clean, minimalist, and compassionate digital space.
7. The page uses the shared `<Layout />` component with appropriate theming.

## Dev Notes

### Homepage Content Specification

**\[Source: docs/content/website-content.md#Homepage (Split Entry)\]**

**CRITICAL**: All homepage content is specified in Portuguese in the content document. Do NOT use placeholder or generic English text.

**Hero Section:**

* **Headline**: "Se hoje há dor, é porque ontem houve amor."
* **Subheadline**: Um espaço de acolhimento e memória para honrar o vínculo que nunca se perde.

**Two-Path Navigation:**

**Button 1: Tutors Path**

* **Button Text**: "Sou Tutor"
* **Subline**: "Para quem compartilha a vida com um animal de estimação"
* **Link Destination**: `/tutors`

**Button 2: Veterinary Partners Path**

* **Button Text**: "Sou Parceiro Veterinário"
* **Subline**: "Para profissionais que cuidam de animais e seus tutores"
* **Link Destination**: `/vets`

**Content Notes:**

* Language: Portuguese (pt-BR)
* Tone: Compassionate, professional, hopeful
* Focus: Warm and welcoming, emphasizing the bond between humans and pets
* Do NOT translate or modify the content - use exactly as specified

### Previous Story Insights

**\[Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record\]**

* `<Layout />` component available at `src/components/composite/Layout.tsx` with theme support
* Layout accepts `theme` prop with values `'dark'` or `'green'`
* Typography fully configured: Castoro for headings (small caps), Fira Sans for body text
* CSS variables defined for `.theme-dark` and `.theme-green` in `src/app/globals.css`
* Layout provides semantic HTML structure: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
* All components follow Server Component pattern by default
* Test pages created at `/test-components` and `/test-layout` for reference

### User Experience Requirements

**\[Source: docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md#Overall UX Vision\]**

* Design should feel **clean, minimalist, and compassionate**
* Professional and trustworthy appearance
* Guide users gently without overwhelming them
* Prioritize **immediate audience segmentation** to reduce confusion

**\[Source: docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md#Key Interaction Paradigms\]**

* Homepage acts as a **portal** with primary interaction being **user's self-selection** into "Tutors" or "Vets" paths
* Each choice accompanied by **brief, clarifying subline** (see Homepage Content Specification above for exact Portuguese content)
* Users taken to dedicated landing page after selection
* MVP landing pages will not have sub-navigation, but layout accommodates future expansion

### Technology Stack

**\[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md\]**

* **Framework**: Next.js \~14.x with App Router
* **Language**: TypeScript \~5.x with strict mode
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS \~3.x
* **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI \~0.x (for any components needed)
* **Typography**: `next/font/google` for Castoro and Fira Sans (already configured)

### Component Architecture

**\[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture\]**

* **Default Pattern**: React Server Components (RSC)
* Only add `"use client"` directive when client-side interactivity is required
* Homepage portal is primarily presentational with links - **Server Component is appropriate**

**\[Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#Routing Architecture\]**

* **Pattern**: Next.js App Router (`/app` directory)
* Routes defined by `page.tsx` files
* Homepage is `src/app/page.tsx`

### Branding & Design System

**\[Source: docs/prd/3-user-interface-design-goals.md#Branding\]**

**Typography:**

* **Headings**: Castoro (rendered in small caps) ← Already configured in Story 1.3
* **Body Text**: Fira Sans ← Already configured in Story 1.3

**Color Palette:**

* **Primary Dark**: #191723
* **Primary Green**: #269A9B
* **Neutral**: #fff (White)

**Color Application:**

* Tutors Section: Dark background (#191723) with Green text (#269A9B)
* Vets Section: Green background (#269A9B) with Dark text (#191723)

**Theme Selection for Homepage:**

* **Recommendation**: Use `theme='dark'` for homepage to create neutral, professional entry point
* Alternatively, could use split design showing both themes, but keep it simple for MVP

```

**File Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` (already exists, needs updating)

### Coding Standards

**\[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#4. React & Next.js Standards\]**

**Component Standards:**

* Server Components by default (no `"use client"` unless needed)
* Explicit return type: `ReactElement` or `JSX.Element`
* One component per file
* No `any` types - use explicit types
* Explicit return types for all functions

**Component Template Pattern:**

```typescript
import type { ReactElement } from 'react';
import { Layout } from '@/components/composite/Layout';

export default function Home(): ReactElement {
  return (
    <Layout theme="dark">
      {/* Page content */}
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

**\[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#4.3 Next.js Specific Standards\]**

**Metadata for SEO:**

```typescript
import { type Metadata } from 'next';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Page Title',
  description: 'Page description',
};
```

**\[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#5. Styling Standards\]**

* **Utility-First**: Use Tailwind utilities instead of custom CSS
* **Conditional Classes**: Use `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`, etc.)
* **Class Organization**: Layout → Sizing → Spacing → Colors → Typography → Effects

**Navigation Links:**

```typescript
import Link from 'next/link';

<Link href="/tutors">Tutors</Link>
<Link href="/vets">Vets</Link>
```

### Accessibility Standards

**\[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#9. Accessibility Standards\]**

* **Goal**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
* **Semantic HTML**: Use `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<a>` (via Link), etc.
* **Keyboard Navigation**: All links must be keyboard accessible (default with `<Link />`)
* **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for text
* **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
* **Accessible Names**: Ensure links have clear, descriptive text

**Note**: Accessibility contrast concern noted in Story 1.3 (3.19:1 ratio for dark/green combinations). For homepage, consider using high-contrast text or default Shadcn/UI colors if needed.

### Testing Requirements

**\[Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md\]**

* **Testing Pyramid**: Unit, Integration, and E2E (Cypress) tests
* **For This Story**: Manual verification sufficient
  * No complex interactivity requiring unit tests
  * Simple navigation links can be manually tested
  * Future E2E tests (Story 1.6+) will cover full user journeys
* **Manual Verification**:
  * Run `npm run dev` and test homepage locally
  * Run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation
  * Test responsive design at different breakpoints
  * Verify links navigate correctly

### Implementation Notes


1. **Server Component**: Homepage should remain a Server Component (no state, no event handlers, just links)
2. **Layout Theme**: Use `theme='dark'` for neutral entry point
3. **Simplicity**: Keep portal design minimal - two clear options, no overwhelming content
4. **Future-Ready**: Design should accommodate future enhancements (e.g., hero image, tagline) but don't over-build
5. **Links Only**: No forms or complex interactions needed - just navigation links to `/tutors` and `/vets`
6. **Typography**: Headings will automatically render in Castoro with small caps (configured globally in Story 1.3)
7. **Existing Routes**: `/tutors` and `/vets` pages do not exist yet, but links can be created now (404 expected until Story 1.5)
8. **Portuguese Content**: All content is in Portuguese (pt-BR) as specified in docs/content/website-content.md. Do not translate or use English placeholders.

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Strategy Appropriateness**: Manual testing is appropriate and sufficient for this story because:

* Simple presentational Server Component with no business logic
* No state management, no user input, no API calls
* Static content with navigation links only
* Future E2E tests (Story 1.6+) will cover full user journeys including navigation

**Manual Tests Performed by Dev** (verified via completion notes):

* ✓ Homepage loads at `/` route
* ✓ Both navigation options clearly visible
* ✓ Links navigate to `/tutors` and `/vets`
* ✓ Responsive design tested on mobile, tablet, desktop
* ✓ Visual design clean, minimalist, compassionate
* ✓ Production build successful (verified: no TypeScript errors)

### Technical Debt

**Identified**: None

**Future Enhancements** (not blocking):

* Story 1.5 will implement `/tutors` and `/vets` landing pages (links currently lead to 404, as expected)
* Future stories will add header/footer content to Layout component
* E2E test coverage in Story 1.6+

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. The implementation:

* Contains no user input or forms
* Handles no sensitive data
* Uses Server Component (no client-side code)
* Safely implements Next.js Link for navigation

### Performance Considerations

**Excellent performance characteristics:**

* Static Site Generation (SSG) produces pre-rendered HTML
* Page size: 8.88 kB (very lightweight)
* First Load JS: 96.1 kB (within acceptable range for Next.js app)
* No images to optimize
* Mobile-first responsive design ensures good mobile performance

### Files Modified During Review

None - No refactoring required. File list remains accurate.
