Excellent, these details are very helpful. I'll incorporate them right away.

Let's address the new information, especially your goal of keeping the price low or free. This is a critical constraint that should guide our technical strategy.

### Analysis of Brevo & Free Tier Options

1.  **Brevo as Email Provider:** Brevo is a great choice. Its free plan is quite generous, typically offering up to 300 emails per day and a good number of contacts, which is more than enough for the MVP. We will specify this in the brief.

2.  **The "Free as Possible" Constraint:** This is the most important factor. While the AWS Free Tier is powerful, it can be complex to manage and carries a risk of small, unexpected costs if you exceed a limit or a service is misconfigured.

Given this, I have a stronger recommendation than raw AWS that perfectly balances your need for a **multi-page site** with the desire for a **truly free and simpler solution**.

### New Recommendation: Netlify or Vercel

Instead of managing AWS services (S3, CloudFront, CodePipeline) directly, I propose we use a platform like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.

Here's why this is a better fit for your project:

* **Truly Free Tier:** Their free tiers are specifically designed for projects of this scale. You get hosting, CI/CD, and serverless functions with a very generous allowance that is highly unlikely to generate costs.
* **Simplicity and Speed:** They are dramatically simpler and faster to set up than a full AWS pipeline. You connect your code repository (e.g., from GitHub), and they handle the entire build and deployment process automatically on every push.
* **All Features Included:** This approach still gives us everything we need:
    * A professional, multi-page website (solving the content segregation).
    * Support for a full-code framework like Next.js (which works great with Claude Code).
    * Serverless functions for integrating the Brevo form securely.
    * A free SSL certificate and a global CDN for fast performance.

In essence, Netlify/Vercel provides the power of the AWS infrastructure but wrapped in a much simpler, developer-friendly package that is optimized for cost-effectiveness.

I will now update the Project Brief with this refined strategy. It's the optimal path to meet all your stated goals.

# **Project Brief: Quando um amor se vai (v3 - Netlify/Brevo Architecture)**

*Changes from v2 are marked with an asterisk (*). Other sections remain the same.*

...

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- The solution must be a multi-page static site to ensure content segregation.
- The design must be mobile-first.
- It must support form integrations with external email marketing services and Google Analytics.

### * Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** A modern static site generator like **Next.js (React)** is recommended for its performance and robust ecosystem.
- **Email Marketing:** **Brevo**, leveraging their free tier for contact management and form processing.
- **Backend (for Forms):** A serverless function to act as a secure intermediary between the website form and the Brevo API.
- **Hosting & Deployment:** **Netlify** or **Vercel** for their generous free tiers, integrated CI/CD, and serverless function support.
- **Domain:** `psicologianavet.com.br`

### * Architecture Considerations
- Multi-page static site architecture, with pages for Home, Tutors, and Veterinarians.
- A serverless function (hosted on Netlify/Vercel) will handle form submissions, sending data to the Brevo API. This prevents exposing any API keys on the frontend.
- Infrastructure and deployment will be managed automatically by Netlify/Vercel's platform, linked to a Git repository.

...

## Risks & Open Questions

### * Key Risks
- **Platform Limitations:** While powerful, the Netlify/Vercel free tier has limits (e.g., build minutes, function executions). If the site grows massively, a paid plan or migration to AWS might be needed in the future. **Mitigation:** The free tier limits are very high and unlikely to be an issue for the foreseeable future.
- **Low Traffic:** The page may not attract enough visitors. **Mitigation:** Plan a content and social media strategy for launch.

### * Open Questions
- What is the API key for the chosen Brevo account? (To be stored securely as an environment variable in Netlify/Vercel, not in the code).

...

## Next Steps

### * Immediate Actions
1.  Set up the **Brevo** account and create two contact lists (one for Tutors, one for Vets).
2.  Set up a free **GitHub** account (if you don't have one) to store the project code.
3.  Set up a free **Netlify** or **Vercel** account and link it to the GitHub account.
4.  Purchase the `psicologianavet.com.br` domain and configure it within the Netlify/Vercel dashboard.
5.  Set up the Google Analytics account to get the tracking code.
6.  Initialize the Next.js project locally.

This revised plan is much more aligned with your goal of a low-cost, low-maintenance, yet professional solution. We can now consider this Project Brief complete and ready to guide the next phase.
